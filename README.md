# Data Analytics Project: Course Popularity on Udemy

The rise of MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) platforms has taken the world of digital learning by storm. It has transformed the face of education and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future as technology evolves. MOOC platforms have become an indispensable tool for not only individuals seeking continuous learning but also for companies seeking to update the skillset of their workforce.

My project focuses on one important KPI for the digital learning sector: the popularity of a course as measured by the number of subscribers. This is an essential metric for MOOC platforms seeking to evaluate their course offerings, for individuals choosing courses on these platforms, and for future educators trying to understand the needs of potential students. Focusing on Udemy, a leading MOOC platform, my project includes collecting data directly from Udemy with API calls, preparing and storing the data, and performing exploratory data analysis to identify key features that influence course popularity. Furthermore, both the data and the data analysis will serve as important stepping stones for the machine learning part of my project which aims to predict the popularity of planned or early stage courses.
