# Final-Project-Udemy-

MOOC (Massive Online Open Courses) platforms have taken the world of digital learning by storm. It has transformed the face of education and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future as technology evolves. Digital learning platforms have become an important channel for learning for not only individuals seeking continuous learning but also for companies seeking to update the skillset of their workforce.

My report aims to focus on an important KPI for the digital learning sector: the number of subscribers of a course. This is an essential metric both for the MOOC platforms seeking to evaluate their course offerings, for individuals choosing courses on these platforms, and for the future educators seeking to understand the needs of potential students. I will try to identity the relevant features that determine course popularity by focusing on one specific MOOC platform, Udemy. Furthermore, my data collection and analysis will serve as important stepping stones for the machine learning model that I will try to develop to help predict the popularity (number of subscribers) of planned or early stage courses on the Udemy platform.
